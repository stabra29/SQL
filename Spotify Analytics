/*This data was downloaded from Keggle, then a table was created to insert Spotify data into
and lastly analytics I created were used to query the data*/

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (

track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,

/*Throughout here I will explore the data with the following SQL commands*/

1) Who are the top 10 artists with the highest average energy and tempo?;
SELECT artist_name, AVG(energy*tempo) AS AvgEnTe
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(energy*tempo) DESC LIMIT 10;
