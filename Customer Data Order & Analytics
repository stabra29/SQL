In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to asses various orders completed by customers and their information. 

1) How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

2) How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

4) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

5) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS JanRev,
Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

6) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM (quantity), 
Product, 
SUM(quantity)*price AS FebRev
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

7) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FS
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FS.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE FS.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
